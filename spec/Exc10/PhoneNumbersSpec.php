 * Given a list of phone numbers, determine if it is consistent. In a consistent
 * phone list no number is a prefix of another. For example:
 *
 * o) Bob 91 12 54 26
 * o) Alice 97 625 992
 * o) Emergency 911
 *
 * In this case, it is not possible to call Bob because the phone exchange would
 * direct your call to the emergency line as soon as you dialled the first three
 * digits of Bob’s phone number. So this list would not be consistent.
